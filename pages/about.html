            boundaries in business. I've studied ALL the things over the years,

            Certified as a Health Coach, Meditation Teacher, Sound Bowl Healer,

            been an amazing experience to apply little aspects of each into
            unique businesses that bring me happiness and joy each day. Oh, and
            work with some of the biggest brands, names and businesses all over

        <p>
          When I'm not crafting up new businesses, pivoting an existing business
          or shutting down the old to make way for the new, I am spending time
          with my beautiful family.
        </p>

        <p>
          My husband and daughter are my biggest fans that are completely
          understanding of my deep desire to make impacts. But, by far the most
          rewarding has been to watch my 1 2 year old daughter, Zoe, embrace her
          artistic ability and start to think of business ideas for herself. Zoe
          even helped to design my logo using my signature.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our collective goal as a family is to create our own magic in the
          world that sees a positive impact with every interaction. It's the
          heart of what we set out to achieve each day.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it's because of that, work is never work. It's fun. It's
          collaborative and it's a joint effort that puts a smile on my face,
          each and every morning.
